As a passionate developer and an avid user of Visual Studio Code, I'm always on the lookout for tools that can streamline my workflow and enhance my coding experience. That's why I'm thrilled to introduce "Copy Combined Markdown" - a new extension that I believe is a game-changer for developers and content creators alike.

## What is "copy combined markdown"?

"Copy Combined Markdown" is a nifty little extension for Visual Studio Code that lets you select multiple files and directories, right-click, and copy their contents as combined markdown directly to your clipboard. This tool is especially useful for those moments when you need to quickly consolidate information from multiple sources, whether for documentation, reporting, or feeding data into tools like ChatGPT.

## Why did i build this?

The idea for "Copy Combined Markdown" came from my own experiences as a developer. Often, I found myself needing to collate code snippets and documentation from various files into a single markdown document. The manual process was time-consuming and error-prone. I needed something that could do this seamlessly without disrupting my flow. Hence, "Copy Combined Markdown" was born.

## Key features

Multiple File Selection: You can select multiple files and even whole directories in the VS Code explorer.
Contextual Menu Integration: Just right-click on your selection and choose "Copy Combined Markdown."
Clipboard Convenience: The combined markdown is copied straight to your clipboard, ready for pasting.
Smart Formatting: The extension automatically formats the content with appropriate markdown syntax, including language-specific code blocks.
How to Use It?
Using "Copy Combined Markdown" is a breeze. After installing the extension from the VS Code Marketplace, simply:

## Open the vs code explorer.

Select the files or directories you need.
Right-click and choose "Copy Combined Markdown".
Paste the markdown wherever you need it!
Behind the Scenes
Developing this extension was a journey of exploration and learning. I delved deep into the VS Code API, experimented with different UX flows, and put a strong emphasis on performance, especially when dealing with large directories. Plus, designing an icon that resonated with the Visual Studio Code aesthetics was a fun challenge!

## Your feedback matters

As with any tool, user feedback is invaluable. I'm all ears for your suggestions, bug reports, or feature requests. Feel free to drop a comment here or visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/skaramicke/vscode-copy-combined-markdown) to contribute.

## Wrapping up

"Copy Combined Markdown" is more than just an extension for me. It's a reflection of my commitment to creating tools that make our lives as developers a bit easier. I hope you find it as useful as I do. Happy coding!
